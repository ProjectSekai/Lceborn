I was not wrong about you, Iceborn. Urathol would be considering you as a small threat until it is too late for him, good for us. He may take me down once by his dirty ways, but I would not fall for it again. We all must stay quick-witted and avoid the same mistake of underestimation that Urathol seem to be so familiar with.

No matter how hard I desire to face Urathol in open battle, one more essential task remains to be completed. I am sending you to obtain Boeth Mask. The area is like no other and none of Boetherians can set foot there. You are still weak, but with Boeth Mask your deep freeze powers shall rise by tripple, you may possess a segment of Boetherian powers.

With this mask a serious harm can be caused against Urathol and his forces, only then you will be ready to stand at my side and marsh towards victory of this mad war. Be quick and do not hesitate, soon everything will be over.
