N: I have called this gathering to finally decide what to do about the threat that grows within every day. Brutal force must be asnwered with the same.

TH: We do not know where and how powerful he is. Nothing can be done at this very moment.

N: Do not force me to remind you the duties of Boetherian, Thardomus!

TH: And you do not have to, yet you can give it a try.

A: Still yourselves! If we wish to come up with the right actions, unity is most necessary.

TY: Anara is right. My brother Urathol swarmed the Frostsky with minions from another world to aid him in gathering the conjured crystonite, who knows what else is he aiming for.

N: Urathol seemingly forged a close alliance with beings from different universe, certain actions needs to be taken.

TH: Very well. Since conjured crystonite is his primal source for energy, source must be suppressed. Tyotho commands land forces so sources are within reach for him.

TY: I will take care of it.

TH: And what is next?

N: Then we strike him with all forces we can gather and blast his minions to oblivion. Urathol shall understand that Boetherians is not a force to trifle with.

A: Blind attack is calamitious for us all. To overcome all odds, Boeth Mask must be obtained and used towards our advantage. Perhaps only then victory is ensured.

N: What meaning your words hold, Anara? You know well that none of us can acquire the mask and mask lies within the deeps of Frostsky not to be used, but to be protected from malignant hand.

A: I did not say that we are to obtain it. The laws of Cold and Growth must be bent and a soul of an Iceborn needs to be summoned. Fragile soul may strengthen over time and finally mask shall be grasped.

TH: This is it. Iceborn shall be a lethal force towards the downfall of Urathol and his summons. Thunar may summon the soul and provide it a proper shape.

N: It is settled then. Urathol wish to demolish the trims of balance for his own ambitions, yet soon he will face his baleful fate.
