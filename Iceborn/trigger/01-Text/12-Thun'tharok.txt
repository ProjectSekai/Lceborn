Is that you, Iceborn? I'm glad to finally see you. Urathol's fortress is falling apart due to your raids and since you are here, I would like to ask you to accompany me and retake the Stone of Farsight.

The Stone of Farsight gives Urathol an opportunity to reveal yet unexplored areas of Frostsky and swarm his summons almost anywhere he desires. An area is heavy in defense, that is why I am in need of a back up. What are your thoughts?

Good, let me just open the gates. There is a little problem though. The passage is protected by natives who built this place for the Stone. Minions were summoned inside the Rockwonder and attacked them by surprise, that is why Urathol didn't have to go through the riddle.

On the stone doors as you see there are signs. There must be some kind of password to open the doors. I am not certain what to do here, perhaps password contains these signs and colors got to do something about it. Maybe switching positions would do the trick, I leave it to you.

Let's retake the Stone as quickly as we can, go!

Good! Watch my back now for some time till I finally grab the Stone from Urathol's grip and blast those summons to oblivion!

My gratitude. Absence of Stone means vast advantage for the Frostsky Sanctuary. I may provide you goods of the highest quality as we all work together against Urathol.
