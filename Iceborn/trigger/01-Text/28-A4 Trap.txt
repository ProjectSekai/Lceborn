A: Thardomus, why are we here? I believe Northorum awaits and this place is not the safest.

A: What's this? Urathol?

TH: It is over, Anara.

A: What? Thardomus, stand with me and let us end this!

U: Do not bother, girl.

A: Have you gone mad?!

A: It is not over yet! You will pay for your crimes, both of you! Boeth Mask is ours and they shall fight to the last drop of blood to protect Frostsky from the hand of yours!

U: Oh I hope they will, I am not leaving without a fight.

A: And I shall be the first one to attempt to do so!

U: You reckon with force beyond measure, girl!

*Fights Anara and kills her quickly*
