I greet you warmly, Iceborn. I pose no threat and I expect the same from you. I have been spending my days here for many years and so my time is running out, my only wish is to get out from here and see what world beyond these cold walls has to offer to warm my old and cold heart.

I am too old to fight my way out, I would rather buy a passage, but I am lacking crystonite. Buy a ring from me, please, buy it and perhaps I would not have to rot here. This ring is not an ordinary jewel, buy it and I will reveal a story behind it as well as its secret way for tremendous intensification.

Be blessed by almighty Vulru, Iceborn. Memory of your generosity will be carried to another world. The ring you just bought was a great mystery through all these years and yet it is. It was worn by Iotopun the great wizard that has ever lived in this world and only Boetherians could be in no way inferior to him.

Urathol the brother of Tyotho invaded his home, I am talking about this place, and defeated the wizard by unkown ways turning this place into a hole of his minions. The amount of minions has increased lately, perhaps they are protecting something valuable, but I just do not care.

I took this ring from the finger of Iotopun and its glow vanished. It is said that the ring requires tremendous energy and will to be turned on. The one that carries the ring must approach two pillars with an iceflower on top of it that lays blue light from time to time and with ring's help summon a being from another world.

The being is bound to be killed and this way ring charges. I never managed to summon anything, but you are Iceborn, you must be strong enough to finally finish this work that I never managed to do myself. I will take my leave now, you have my eternal gratitude. Farewell, Iceborn.
