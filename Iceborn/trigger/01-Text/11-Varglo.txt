What? What are you doing here? You aren't supposed to be here, unless you want to meet your end sooner, hehehe. In that case I can be of help. I am planning to visit my pals who are set behind the bars and attempt to free them once again.

You see, I got myself into a terrible fix, because it was Varglo who was disobediant and caused troubles and so Varglo managed to save his own skin while my pals did not! Now they take the blame and I feel an obligation to do something about it.

Come with me, there is a store-room close to the cage of my pals, take anything from there as long as you don't put us into trouble. What do you say?

Okay, just follow me and stick close, I don't want you to attract not-so-needed attention, all right? (Starts walking)

The wanderers and keepers of Lower levels are as cruel as could possibly be. We, who live here just to have where to lay one's head, are treated unfairly, all this leads to disobediance even though punishments are unenviable.

The cage they are put in is not an ordinary one, I hope my pals are okay. It's been a while since the last time I saw them so they better haven't started eating each other, I fear the worst.

Here we are. This is the place. These gates are sealed with magic lock and Varglo is not smart enough to figure out how to go through it. Perhaps your wit is quick enough to rescue my pals before we get cought and slaughtered!

Pals: Eat him alive! (Attacks Varglo) (Quest done)

Varglo: Aaaaagh! (Dies)

(Enemy invades and kills pals)

Pals: Ah! Help! Help!
