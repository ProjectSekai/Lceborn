AN: Yet again your underestimation led to this unpleasant situation, Urathol. Northorum has slipped from your grasp because you didn't end Iceborn when you had the chance. Iceborn also managed to acquire the Boeth Mask, perhaps now you would hold him as a potent threat, yet it is too late.

AN: Northorum and your brother's forces are gathering nearby and they shall not stand idle for long. Underestimation and blind pride is the trait of yours and I am certain you might end up like your father, because you can not listen what is being told.

U: Shut your mouth, Andalgon! What do you know about my father? At the matter of fact, it is you who led him to his death, but do not think I am the case.

AN: What are you speaking? I but guided your father through the path of greater discovery and I wish to guid you as well, but you are blinded by your loss and this shall cost you. And why would I want your death, have you forgotten why am I here?

U: Do not hold me a fool, Andalgon. You tricked my father and you plan to do the same with me. You wish to let me pass through the portal and gain everything I desire, yet you plan to summon beings and take control over the Frostsky and I would not let that happen.

AN: Have you gone mad, Urathol?!

*Urathol transforms*

U: Frostsky is mine as well as the portal. You did your part, Andalgon, you shall not be missed. And carry these words to the afterlife, I am not my father!

AN: You are right, you are not, you are much worse than him!

*Kills Andalgon*
