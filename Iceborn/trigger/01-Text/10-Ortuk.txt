Hey! Hey you! I was cought stealing from the Sanctuary and I was lucky to leave that place alive. Job is not done, yet I can not set foot there anymore. Golems weren't so happy about it and the next thief may see no mercy.

What about you? Would you be willing to finish my work? I would give you something in return of course. Job is to steal three rubies of Frostsky from the necks of glass statues. Think about it, take your time. Come back with three of them and see fortune fall upon you. Oh, and watch out for those mad Golems, make sure they do not see you when you put your fingers to use.

Oh splendid! You sure tricked those mad Golems, haha! Take this, as promised, whatever meaning does this scrap hold.
