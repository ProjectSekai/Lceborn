N: Do not get mistaken, Anara. I am but focused on the current events and on unpredictable Urathol.

A: I know you more than you think, you are eager to face Urathol and this is troubling your mind the least. There is something else, tell me, I want to make it easier for you.

N: I fear to disappoint you all, I am afraid that my strength is not enough and the Frostsky may get swallowed by the unknown future. If my father knew what a coward his son is, what would he say?

A: You are not a coward, Northorum, I have not seen anyone more dedicated and bold than you are. And remember, you are not alone in this, that is why we are much more preeminent.

N: Promise me that when the times comes, you would stay away from Urathol and his summons.

A: No, I would not stand down! I am prepared to give my life for it and that is how every Boetherian should act in this situation.

N: I would not forgive myself if something happened to you.

A: Everything will be all right, do not let your feelings overwhelm you during these times. You are a good man, Northorum, your empathy would not be forgotten, I promise you that. (Teleports)

N: It is much more than just empathy. Much more...
