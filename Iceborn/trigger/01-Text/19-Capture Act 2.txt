N: Urathol...

N: I did not expect you to make such a huge mistake.

U: I have come here with an offer - join me or see yourself vanished from the living world like the rest who were blundering enough not to see that the new era is here.

N: You probably lost your mind if you ask me to ally with you. Oh, you have already lost it the moment you decided to stand against the laws of the universes.

U: I loathe every bit of it. Frostsky should acclaim me as their saviour and not as their enemy, it is I who seek to cleanse this world and other universes from the infection brought by Boetherians.

U: You did nothing when my father was killed in cold blood and his throne was claimed by my brother Tyotho, none of you corrupted Boetherians had a sense of justice that time.

N: Your father was a madman just like you. He promised nothing but calamity which had almost fallen upon the Frostsky, that is why you will follow your father's footsteps and end your days here and now.

U: You are so naive, Northorum. You not only reject my offer but insult the memory of my father and this shall be answered.

(Fight starts)

N: Ugh!

N: What?..

N: Argh!

(Fight ends)

U: Our decisions forge our destiny, you chose yours, Northorum. I will crush all of your kind one by one until there is no resistance and then I shall see Frostsky rise to its peak of untold future.
