U: This can not be...

N: Enjoy your last moments, Urathol, soon your head shall part from your body!

TY: Hold. Despite all, he is still my brother who loved his father with all his heart. I want him to live and perhaps one day he shall understand what were his wrongs.

N: You took many lives today, among them Anara's. There will be no mercy no matter what punishment will be given!

U: There is no place for me on this universe anymore, take my life and please end my suffering... I can not live knowing I failed my father...

TY: No, you will live and within time all wounds shall heal. You will be imprisoned in the depths of Boethsoul until your draw breath.

N: Iceborn's support was essential in our journey, Anara did the right thing. And now let us rebuild the Frostsky and look forward the bright future.
