You finally arrived and with the blessing of Thunar I suppose. He brought you to the 9th universe with higher purpose. My brother Urathol is blinded by thirst for power and knowledge beyond boundaries of our universe and so due to this Urathol do everything to obtain as much conjured crystonite as possible.

This precious material provide him energy that one day may be enough to bend Boetherians themselves. This would lead to calamitious disbalance of worlds and universes. But you are already familiar with all this, that is why you arrived here, because your soul is noble, Iceborn.

There is a powerful, yet untreated and not ready to be collected piece of conjured crystonite to the north-east of here. Unfortunately Urathol's minions has already taken it under control, but Urathol himself delay with his arrival. I urge you to go there and neutralize the crystal from further use towards his plans.

Before you go, accept this gift as my gratitude for you. This may help you to save time that is seemingly precious at these hard moments or perhaps even save your life if you find yourself trapped.
--------------
The crystal may not be abused by Urathol anymore. If not you, Iceborn, the crystal of Boundwalker at Urathol's hands would mean his vast advantage against us. Let us put cheering aside and focus on another matter of great concern.

We already caused a baneful blow since the energy of crystal is unreachable for my brother, but we cannot strike him down yet. Northorum the Boetherian of Blizzards have been captured by Urathol himself. If we are to face my brother in open battle for the harmony and balance of universes, Northorum must be unchained and stand with us.

Northorum is one of the most powerful Boetherians among many and his support is essential in our task. The chains that holds Northorum imprisoned are firm beyond imagening and it would require an unbreakable will as well as sharp mind, but you are able to cope with it, Iceborn.
