In the name of Vulru, what is this stray being doing in the deeps of Boethsoul? If you are here, you are probably after a Boeth mask, is that right? Nevermind, I do not want to know.

Since you are here and you do not seem to be in a rush, would you be willing to assist me for a brief moment? I designed a trap powered by the red crystal to catch the Thunder Dragon.

That irritating flying thing is disturbing me for a long time by now, I can not stand this danger to be attacked suddenly from no where. So I built a trap to get rid of the dragon.

All I need is someone brave enough to face the dragon and drag it to the jaws of my trap. Well?

Not far from here, there are three traps. You will have to drag the dragon on each of them and then trigger the trap by shooting off the spheres that keeps it tight. Only one shot can be launched per trap, so make sure the dragon is right over the crystal during the activation.

Use this to call the dragon and may Vulru help you on your task. Oh and by the way, do not kill the dragon, the aim is to catch and not to slay, you got that right? Now go and put an end to his deadly presence in the deeps of Boethsoul.

You did it and most importantly my trap worked perfectly. Dragon seem to be attracted to you somehow, you can keep it as your companion, just take it away from this place, I do not wish to see it here anymore. Do we have a deal?
