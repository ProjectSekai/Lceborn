So it is you. Iceborn they call you. What a fortunate coincidence that an opportunity to finally meet you presents itself.

I wanted to look you in the eye and see what these old, wicked Boetherians saw in you.

And so you stand here, yet I see nothing but weakness and fear.

I could end your despicable life here and now in no time.

But I am generous or at least not as cruel as I may seem to be.

I would not lay a finger on you, not yet. I advise you to consider leaving my palace, because we both know how your raids will end, don't we?

I will take my leave now, because seemingly my companion can not stand still without putting his weapon to use.

But firstly let me introduce you to my fellow. He may accompany you so that you wouldn't feel so lonely when we are absent.

Have fun you two! Usually I wouldn't miss a chance to enjoy seeing my enemies crushed, but currently more important matters awaits me.

Farewell, Iceborn, I hope this is the first and the last time I am forced to witness your presence.
