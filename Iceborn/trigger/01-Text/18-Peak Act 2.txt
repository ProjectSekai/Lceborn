AN: Did you know that the crystal of the Boundwalker has slipped from your grasp?

AN: Why are you silent? If not your underestimation, this would not have happened! They summoned an Iceborn soul, do you even know what that is?

U: Silence! Know your place, Andalgon!

AN: I... I am sorry... But within the absence of Boundwalker's crystal, your progress slows down, you may need much more time to gather enough of conjured crystonite to open the Dread Portal.

U: They won some time, a matter of low importance. Since I am powerful enough to break-down anyone, I will put all conjured crystonite towards the Dread Portal, I know just a place for it.

AN: Do not rush with your actions, Urathol, and do not underestimate your enemy once again. I urge you to get rid of the Iceborn before it is too late.

U: Who are you to put your will upon me? How that tiny thing could pose any considerable threat? I know a much better target, his absence may quake through the foundation of all hostile.
