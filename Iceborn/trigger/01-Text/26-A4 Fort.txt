N: Urathol wish to complete what his father could not - open the Dread Portal. Once he has enough of conjured crystonite energy to finally open the portal, Frostsky is destined to be taken under the rule of Urathol. None of us could stop what might come through that portal.

TY: That is why we must strike now and shut down that hole for eternity. There is no time to be wasted.

N: Not yet. We must wait until Thardomus and Anara joins us, only then we might cause a fatal blow and end Urathol once and for all.
