U: You wretched fools! You dare to oppose me? You have clue who you are dealing with! I will blow you away from the surface of the Frostsky and see end to your pity lives!

N: Hold your tongue, Urathol! Your reign is nearly over and crimes of yours shall be answered soon!

U: Is that all? Pity...

U: Come on now! I will have you dance a little bit more before your death!

U: A true beauty she was, yet no more!

U: How many more of you must die? Foolishness has no bounds!

U: Do not think you can trifle with me!

U: Your pain shall be endless!
