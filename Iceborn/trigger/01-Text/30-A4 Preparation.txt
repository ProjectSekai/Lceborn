U: Time has come, father. This is the day I will redeem myself for not supporting you when you needed it the most.

U: Come, my brother, come and let us see who has the right to rule the Frostsky and its people!

N: Iceborn, the portal is not yet open, but it gathers its energy through three crystals. I need you to shut these crystals down and prevent portal from opening. One of crystals lies within the palace where portal itself dwells.

N: For that to achieve you will have to go through the Cleansing Tower, be aware that it releases energy pulses that devastates everything around it. Once you are in the palace, do not provoke Urathol prematurely.

N: Once the Portal is no longer a concern, you will have to shut down the Cleansing Tower for us to advance further by escorting a neutralizing machine provoking Urathol. I swear to rip his heart from his chest in the name of Anara!
