Most sincere greetings to you, Iceborn. I am Atantrimedius the son of Garshon and the gatekeeper of Boethsoul Alcazar. I know why you are here as well as your just intentions towards Boeth Mask, that is why I shall let you pass through the gates and enter the Alcazar where mask lies.

Yet gates can be opened only when the Boetheart is charged to its max and it cannot be charged because of Urathol's summons who has taken the Veijor Cube and infected it with disbalance of cosmic energies that holds the equilibrium throughout the deeps.

I need your help to restore Veijor Cube's form and dispose the existence of Urathol's infection. You will also need 15 Icethorn Blossoms in order to charge the Boetheart, do you have them? Nevermind, at this point the main concern is the Cube, are you ready?
---
Follow me.
---
Those scabs sense danger, get ready. Your target is to light all 8 pedestals via 4 orb triggers at sides, then I will be able to remove the infection from the dismantled Cube of Veijor. Be quick!
---
Back me up until I deal with the infection!
---
It is done! Now make sure you have all the Icethorn Blossoms needed for Boetheart to charge and open the gates. Good luck on your journey, Iceborn.
