I am just wondering, what is up there?

When I shall claim it all, what name will I endure? A cruel tyrant, who stood against his own kind for the thirst of knowledge and power, or a victor, who had the courage and strength to grasp the undiscovered?

It is you who set me on the proper path towards a new age of Frostsky, I find your guidance most valuable during these times when the drums of war echo through the land.

Then I shall stop them first.

Then they will fall divided, one by one they shall witness the cost their resistance. The new era is here and there will be no Boetherians to force their will upon us in the name of so-called balance.
