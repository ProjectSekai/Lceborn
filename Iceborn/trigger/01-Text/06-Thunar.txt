I am Thunar, a Boetherian of this very place. You have been brought here to be guided through path of untold creation. Your body is weak and it can barely take or deal any harm, which is inseparable from the harsh environment of this world.

Let us not linger anymore and put words into action, forging strength and will of a being, which soon may rise from the weak as the conqueror of cold. Absorb any essence lying within these unseen wanderers and see yours filled.

Ahhh.. Your rapid growth is of note. Find and bring me two Boeth Omens and I shall see end to this shape of yours granting you a primal form of Iceborn.

The Cold shall awaken you from this sleep and the Growth may raise you through blizzards and the coldest ice. Fall to the arms of Vulru and set foot here once again, yet as another being.
