U: I knew I could trust you, Thardomus. You are the wisest among them all.

TH: Northorum's absence wrecked the union of Boetherians, you won, Urathol. I am sworn to follow you to the end.

U: Fortune is all mine! There is one task for you, with your help we will get rid of all what is left of your collapsed union and then a new dawn shall rise for us all.
