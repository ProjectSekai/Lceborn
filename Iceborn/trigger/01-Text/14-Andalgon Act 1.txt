What is it that weighs your mind?

You must realize, that no victory is claimed within the absence of violence and blood and in order to forge a new reign, certain sacrifice is needed.

Strike troubles and doubt from your mind and focus on your task. Boetherians may not stand idle and they shall attempt to stop you at all costs.

Together they are a potent force, but divided they are nothing but pests that stand between you and your ultimate goal.

You will break free from this imprisonment and go far beyond measures of capability that is not yet known to anyone.

I have something for you.

He may aid you to the farthest corners of the Frostsky and see your enemies bow before you. (Sargeras: My hands, your will.)

Everything is in front of you, you just have to take it!
