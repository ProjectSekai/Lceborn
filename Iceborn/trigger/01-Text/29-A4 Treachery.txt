N: Thardomus, your delay is costly. Where have you been? And where is Anara, I thought she was with you?

TH: She is dead, killed by Urathol himself.

N: What? Have you lost your mind, Thardomus? She can not be dead, speak!

TH: And soon you all will be, unless you lay your arms now and then perhaps your lives shall be spared.

N: It is you who trapped Anara, is that right?! Your treachery is a disgrace to your origin! You would not get away with this!

TH: Can't you see? You are alone, it would be wise of you to make a decision and come to an agreement without spilling blood, since the odds are certainly not in your favour.

N: You filthy scum! I will see you rot in the fields of Aze for what you have done!

*Northorums fights Thardomus and kills him*

N: Prapare for the confrontation, we will give it all and show Urathol that we are not the force to trifle with!
